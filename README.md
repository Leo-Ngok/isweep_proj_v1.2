# isweeep_proj_v1.2
 This project is designed to investigate the CVD index of a person, and is more parametized with weather condition.<br />
	This App is written in C# and xamarin forms, so both android and ios platform are supported.<br />
	This app includes the following functions:<br />
	1. **CVD calculator**<br />
	2. **Interval Timer**<br />
	3. **Weather forecast** and <br />
	4. **showing previous records**.<br />
## CVD calculator
The calculator runs everyday in the morning to calculate your CVD index, taking weather conditon into account.<br />
		Thus, the app may send you some reminder(溫提) so that you can take a look and mind your health.<br />
## Interval Timer
 You could consider it as a countdown timer, but once you have set the rest time and the work time, <br />
	the timer countdown the two times repeatedly, so when time is up, you could either return to work, <br />
	or take a rest. *Note that it is not recommended to quit the app when the timer is running.*<br />
## Weather forecast
 Since weather condition is now also taken into account, the app shows you the temperature and humidity
	of the next 5 days.
## Previous records
 Here, you can check the CVD index, weather conditions, concentrations of pollutants in the past.<br />
